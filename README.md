# Simple SCP Themed Flask App
This is a Flask-based web application that simulates a role-based access system inspired by the SCP Foundation universe. Users with different clearance levels can view and manage SCP objects based on their assigned access rights. The application includes user authentication, secure session handling, and an admin dashboard for managing both users and SCP entries.
